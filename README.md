# WorldClim Implicit Neural Representation - Work In Progress

> This project provides implementations of multiple Implicit Neural Representation models as well as a training implementation for the WorldClim Dataset. \
The code is meant to be modular and transferable with users only required to update the configuation files and provide some pointer to their dataset.
